# TODO List for future visualization and functionality

## Visualization and additional functionality
- Add coloring to different types and file extensions as leafs/endpoints (small task)
- add buttons for "expand all" and "collapse all" for easy use + search functionality, which marks the searched and found node
- include .json generation routine based on task, which will be a python script most likely
- include in development pipeline for quick overview as quick launch extensions or similar
- VSCode right-click functionality for selected directory for a quick overview

## Merging  with bigger analysis tool
- Testing and give circle inner info like "tested"/"vetted"/"reviewed"
- For (sub-)domain checking and validation (Automated Ownership Detection): "Scanned" & "Result"
- SOme scores about attack vectors performed inspired by structure pf CVE/CWE/MITRE
- Azure Cloud Mapping and traversal overview information (Tenants/Subscriptions/Ressources like Workspaces or Azure Keyvaults)
- Kubernetes Cluster Mapping within Managed Azure Cloud Environment / Azure AD and on premise systems

## Transformations into other structures: From tree to graph
- endpoint checking for multiple occurences/usages in e.g. imports and process pipeline
- basically PDG of some software stack like ArduPilot: use existing research to leverage analysis (Web Security/ Systems Security)
- Flow of function calls of the same function throughout different files for visualization
